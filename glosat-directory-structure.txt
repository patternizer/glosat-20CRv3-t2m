Main directory divisions:

    production
        location for working software and analysis systems
        holds final results outputs as wel as the raw data used to create them
        does not include any deprecated data, older outdated input data or old versions  

    development
        location for initila development work and testing
        may hold multiple input data sources being tested for possible use
        may hold alternative or oudaed version of input data

    archive
       any data, inputs, outputs to be kept for archiving at the end of the project


Directory subdivisions:

    Data
        raw
            source data, unmodified and with clear metadata, version numbers within directory or readme files
        interim
            any intermediate processed, cleaned or modified data created for this project, not considered raw data and not a final result output
            ideally use of this directory would be limited, this analysis would typically occur on scratch rather the gws and should be repeatable via 
            code within the repo, therefore when analysis processing times allow the intermediate data will not need to be retained
        results
            Final output data (versioned). The data here will have been re-created using input data located within the relevant parent directory. 
            i.e. results data in the production parent directory will use raw or intermediate data from the production directory (not simply copied here)
    references
        Data manuals, user-guides, input data documentation etc
        Not the location for project generated documentation
    reports-figures
        Any figures or data reports generated by code, e.g. for sharing
        Not intended to be used to store deliverable reports created manually, those will be within the confluence pages

User directory - Recommend against additional user directories within the group workspace

Subdirectories - users will need to create suitable subdirectories within the above structure at the point they are needed. 
                 If these follow a logical structure then subsequent users can follow and add to that structure.
